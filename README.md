# Word-Guess-Game

The word guessing game follows the rules of the classic hangman game. The objective of this game is to discover a word by guessing the letters that compose it.

## Game Overview

The game starts after pressing any key on the keyboard. The word to guess is represented by a row of underscores which represent each letter of the guessing word. The player can start guessing by pressing the keys from A to Z. If the player guesses a letter included in the word, it will be discovered in all its positions replacing the underscores characters. If the suggested letter does not exist in the word, it will appear in a list of incorrect letters. The game ends when the player guesses the whole word (Win) or when the number of guesses reaches zero (Lose).
